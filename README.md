## AgroFind
AgroFind is an AI incorporated chat bot created to aid in the identification of plants, noticable disease and/or pest infestation.

Built with Gemini AI, it takes the user input with has to be a picture with jpg, jpeg or png extension/format. It then gives the user the summary of noticable features about the plant.
It is made with Flask, HTML and Tailwind to "automate" and ease the stress to complete an assignment given in school.

<b>Leverage:</b> With Google Lens, it would only identify the image. Sometimes it would give you different names and you would not know the one to pick. Compared to using normal AI, with AgroFind, the user doesn't have to bother about how to construct the prompt. He would get the summary which would address the points needed specifically.
